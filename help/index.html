					Gridlock is a grid-based, <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>-compliant 
					WordPress theme for use on serious blogs and webzines. At its release, Gridlock was one of a 
					very small set of themes that allowed for Webzine-style layout in WordPress. Gridlock has 
					built-in support for <abbr title="Scalable Inman Flash Replacement">sIFR</abbr>, 
					<a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> social bookmarking, and an 
					About Page. Aside from bug fixes, this will likely be the last version of Gridlock.
				</p>
				<p>
					This WordPress theme is released under a Creative Commons By-Nc-Sa 3.0 
					Licence. See <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">the contract</a> for 
					more information.

			<h4>Design</h4>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section_body">
			<p>
		    Before you upload Gridlock, it is best to do some customising of the template's design yourself in 
			Photoshop for a unique blog. Two <code>.psd</code> files are included in the <code>design</code> folder 
			of the theme package; one of these is <code>about.psd</code>, the about blurb graphic on the right column 
			of Gridlock; the other is <code>logo.psd</code>, which is the upper logo at the top of the page. By 
			default, this logo says &quot;Gridlock&quot;; however, this image should be edited to reflect the name 
			of your blog.
		    </p>
			<p>
			The stock typeface used throughout Gridlock is Helvetica Neue Ultra Light; many Mac OS X computers have a 
			variant of Helvetica Neue installed. If you do not have Helvetica Neue, and still want to use it, you 
			can purchase the Helvetica Neue Ultra Light typeface for $21.95 USD from 
			<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/PurchaseOptions?id[]=10269" title="Purchase Neue Helvetica 25 Ultra Light">
			this site</a>. If you do not want to purchase a typeface, the best stock typefaces generally installed 
			on Mac OS X and Windows are Helvetica (Mac OS X) and Arial or Century Gothic (Windows), respectively. If 
			you want some more character, it's best to check out <a href="http://www.dafont.com/" title="DaFont">DaFont</a> 
			for a free typeface; generally, very lightweight sans-serif typefaces will look best with Gridlock.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once you are done editing the images to your liking, use Photoshop's Save for Web dialog and save the images 
			as GIF images. The logo image is <code>gridlock/images/logo.gif</code>; the about image is  
			<code>gridlock/images/about.gif</code>.	Saving over these images will replace the existing images with your 
			newly-edited ones. It is best to backup your <code>.psd</code> files in a safe location in case you wish 
			to make later edits.

			<h4>Installation</h4>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section_body">
			<p>
				Gridlock is very simple to install. Simply upload the <code>gridlock-theme</code> directory to your WordPress 
				themes directory (generally <code>wp-content/themes/</code>). Once Gridlock is finished uploading, 
				navigate to the Design Tab in the WordPress Administration Panel. You should be able to click on 
				the Gridlock screenshot and activate the theme.	
			</p>
			<p>
				If your blog is on <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>, you cannot 
				use Gridlock from this package. If you'd like to use Gridlock on WordPress.com, you'll have to request 
				that WordPress.com administrators add it to WordPress.com.
			</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	
		<div class="section">
			<div class="section_head">
			<h4>Configuration</h4>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section_body">
			<p>
				Once Gridlock has been installed and activated, a tab named &quot;Gridlock Options&quot; will appear 
				in the Design section of WordPress. Clicking this tab will lead you to the Gridlock configuration 
				page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of this page, you will probably never have to edit the code of Gridlock. Nearly all of the 
				theme's functionality can be modified from this panel. Below is a list of the functionality in the 
				panel:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="highlight">Featured Category</span> The primary category, to be used in the 
				main section of the Gridlock index page (and spill down into the left secondary story box.) This 
				is selectable from the drop-down list. This category must contain at least one post to be selectable.
				</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Featured Section Head</span> The section head to the featured location 
				(the heading in blue). Leaving this blank will reset it to its default of &quot;Currently Featured&quot;.</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Past Feature Section Head</span>  The section head to the secondary 
				location for features in the left centre box. Leaving this field blank will reset it to its default 
				of &quot;Previously Featured&quot;.</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Use secondary category for third post</span>  Unchecking this box will make 
					Gridlock perform a one-category list, instead of in a webzine-like structure. If you want 
					Gridlock to behave like a normal WordPress theme, simply uncheck this box and set the Featured 
					Category to All Categories.
				</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Secondary Category</span> The secondary category. This category is displayed 
					in the right centre box. This is selectable from the drop-down list. This category must contain at 
					least one post to be selectable. If &quot;Use secondary category for third post&quot; is unchecked, 
					Gridlock will ignore this setting.
				</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Secondary/Tertiary Section Head</span> The section head for the secondary 
					location. Leaving this field blank will reset it to its default of &quot;Secondary Feature&quot;</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">About Page Post Slug</span> This is a post slug for the full biography page, 
					as defined in the &quot;Post Slug&quot; field when writing a page. This currently requires pretty 
					permalinks to be in use on your site. This slug will rewrite the About Page links to 
					<code>http://<span class="param">yoursiteuri</span>/<span class="param">post_slug</span></code>, 
					where <code><span class="param">yoursiteuri</span></code> is your WordPress site URI and 
					<code><span class="param">post_slug</span></code> is the Post Slug you enter into this field. Leaving 
					this field blank disables the About link in the head navigation bar as well as the 
					&quot;read more&hellip;&quot; link in the about blurb in the sidebar.
				</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">About Page Sidebar Blurb</span> The blurb that appears in the &quot;About&quot; 
					section of the Gridlock sidebar. Leaving this blurb blank will disable the sidebar About blurb. When 
					writing this blurb, keep in mind that it should be short, no more than four or five sentences. 
					Currently, HTML is not allowed in this field.
				</li> 
				<li><span class="highlight">Photos Link URI</span> A URI for the &quot;photos&quot; link in the head 
					navigation. Placing a URI to a photo page in this box will enable a &quot;photos&quot; link in the 
					head navigation. You may link to any valid website. I used this to link to 
					<a href="http://flickr.com" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>.
				</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">del.icio.us Username</span> A username for the 
					<a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> social bookmarking system. Entering 
					a username here will allow Gridlock to build a linkroll on the index page. Leaving this field blank 
					will disable the del.icio.us linkroll functionality. 
				</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">del.icio.us Section Head</span> The section head to the del.icio.us linkroll, 
					if the linkroll is enabled. Leaving this field blank will reset it to its default 
				of &quot;del.icio.us Links&quot;.</li>
				<li><span class="highlight">Display Options</span> These options are fairly self-explanatory checkboxes. 
					<br /><br />
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Centre Page</strong> This will centre the page as opposed to having the theme left-aligned. 
					    This is probably the #1 most-requested feature, so here you all go.</li>
						<li><strong>Disable sIFR Typography</strong> Checking this box will turn off the sIFR system. 
							All sIFR'ed typography will be rendered in their CSS values (<code>Helvetica, Arial, 
							sans-serif</code>).</li>
						<li><strong>Disable Internet Explorer 6 Warning</strong> If the user is running IE6, a warning 
							will be displayed across the top of the page to alert the user that they should upgrade to 
							Internet Explorer 7 or Mozilla Firefox. Checking this box will disable this warning.</li>
						<li><strong>Disable integrated favicon</strong> Gridlock forces its own favicon, a black square 
							containing a grey asterisk, into the template using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. If you 
							do not wish to use this favicon, checking this box disables it.</li>
						<li><strong>Disable logo</strong> Checking this box will turn off the upper <code>logo.gif</code> 
							and simply render the background in its place. This leaves a rather awkward space that you should 
							fix.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<h4>Header Links</h4>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section_body">
			<p>
				Header links are hard-coded into the Gridlock template. If you would like to add new links in the 
				header, you will need to edit the <code>header.php</code> file in the <code>gridlock-theme</code> 
				directory. The code for header links starts on line 82; there is a small tutorial sitting in a 
				PHP comment on how to add links.

			<div class="section_body">
			<p>
				Gridlock contains sIFR support for the Cyrillic character set; however, it is not turned on by default and 
				is not included in the administration panel. In the <code>gridlock/sifr</code> directory, there are 
				some Cyrillic typefaces for the sIFR system; these faces are suffixed by <code>_cyr.swf</code> instead 
				of simply <code>.swf</code>. To use one of these typefaces, edit <code>header.php</code> to reflect the 
				Cyrillic type file instead of the original <code>helvneue.swf</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you don't know what Cyrillic is but decided to read this section anyway, Cyrillic is the character 
				set used by most of the ex-Soviet countries, primarily Russia, Ukraine, and Bulgaria, not to mention 
				countries like Kazakhstan, Belarus, and the ex-Yugoslavian states (Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, etc.) 
				Since you've been patient and learned something new (or were just interested,) you get a bonus &mdash; 
				Gridlock comes with a bonus sIFR typeface, Avant Garde Gothic,  in the <code>gridlock/sifr</code> 
				directory for the Latin alphabet.

			<h4>Features &amp; Bugs</h4>

			<div class="section_body">
			<p>
				If you find a bug in Gridlock or would like to request a new feature be added, drop me a line at 
				<a href="mailto:eston@socialuxe.com" title="E-Mail eston">eston@socialuxe.com</a>. I generally 
				try to reply to all of the e-mails I receive, and any bugs or features will be considered for repair 
				(or addition) in the next release.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're a WordPress developer yourself and would like to fix some bugs or build some functionality 
				into Gridlock, feel free to send me your changes (either a <code>diff</code> for a bug or your 
				additional code in case of a feature.) If I find your changes beneficial to the Gridlock codebase, 
				I'll roll them into the next version and contribute you with its development.
